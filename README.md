# Hello, I'm Alexis Hampton

I'm working on a Bachelor of the Arts Degree in Computer Science at Queens College. I make games in Godot using C#. I mostly post my finished games/projects here. But I put my (private) work-in-progress projects on my [personal account](https://github.com/xXClawtheWolfXx)
